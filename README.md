This is a tool I built for my uni diploma <br/>
Its purpose is visualising quality management tools <br/>
<br/>
Pretty simple to use: <br/>
<b> Ishikawa Diagram </b> <br/>
  1. Add the branches/subbranches/subsubbranches by pressing the add button on its parent <br/>
  2. Rename the branches by presing the edit button, then press enter to confirm rename <br/>
  3. Save the diagram as png by pressing the button in bottom-right <br/>
<br/>
<b> Pareto Chart </b> <br/>
   1. Add the names of the parameters <br/>
   2. Add their values <br/>
   3. If you call the parameter "Others" it goes to the right-most spot <br/>
   4. 3. Save the diagram as png by pressing the button in bottom-right <br/>
